Flatiron Annual Report 2014
========

The FAR is currently hosted at [flatiron-labs.github.io/far-2014/](http://flatiron-labs.github.io/far-2014/). The final domain will be at [flatironschool.com/far](http://flatironschool.com/far).

This is a [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) project using slim and stylus.

To compile the stylus you will need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. This is a breeze through brew. Just type `brew install node`. Voil√†.
