Outcomes 2016
========

The final domain will be at [outcomes.flatironschool.com/](http://outcomes.flatironschool.com).

This is a [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) project using slim and stylus.

To compile the stylus you will need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. This is a breeze through brew. Just type `brew install node`. Voil√†.

This is being hosted on GitHub pages. 

**Note**
As of 7/24 or there abouts this will just serve as a place to redirect traffic to flatironschool.com/outcomes. That currently lives on PR https://github.com/flatiron-labs/outcomes-2016/pull/3
